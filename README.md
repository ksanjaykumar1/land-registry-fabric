Each land is uniquely idenitified by Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN)

The Union government of India plans to issue a 14-digit identification number to every plot of land in the country. And then subsequently integrate its land records database with revenue court records and bank records, as well as Aadhaar numbers on a voluntary basis.

The govt. aim this project to be as “the Aadhaar for land”, a number (ULPIN) that would uniquely identify every surveyed parcel of land and prevent land fraud, especially in the hinterlands of rural India, where land records are outdated and often disputed. The identification will be based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of the land parcel.
